## Real-time API
The FORMIDE Real-time API can be used to get real-time messages from FORMIDE clients that you have authorization for. You can listen to messages via the Web API as well as via the Client API, the only difference is the root URL used to connect to the correct socket server. We strongly recommend using one of the [socket.io](https://socket.io) client libraries, as these are out of the box compatible with our Real-time API.
