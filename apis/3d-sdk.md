The FORMIDE 3D SDK is a javascript app framework that can be used as the basis of FORMIDE apps. It handles all the repetetive parts for you, like authenticating a FORMIDE user, uploading STL files to the platform, generating a 3D environment in [Three.js](https://threejs.org) and much more. With just a few lines of code, you already have a complete functional app to build your ideas on!
