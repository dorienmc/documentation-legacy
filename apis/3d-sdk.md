## 3D SDK
The FORMIDE 3D SDK is a javascript app framework that can be used as the basis of FORMIDE apps. It handles all the repetetive parts for you, like authenticating a FORMIDE user, uploading STL files to the platform, generating a 3D environment in [Three.js](http://threejs.org) and much more. With just a few lines of code, you already have a complete functional app to build your ideas on!

### Authentication
To authenticate a user on the SDK you don't have to do anything! The FORMIDE platform takes care of the whole user authentication flow for you, all you have to do is publish your application built on this SDK to the platform.

To simulate authentication locally, you can log in the CLI tools and run your app locally from there. This will authenticate you as the user of this app with the correct access token.
