## Raft
A technique used to prevent warping. Instead of directly on the build surface, parts are built on top of a “raft” of material that you remove and dispose of post-print. The raft is larger than the part and so has more adhesion. Rafts are primarily used with ABS to help with bed adhesion. Rafts are also used to help stabilize models with small footprints (eg. a tall building), or to create a strong foundation on which to build the upper layers of your part. If your only concern is bed adhesion it is better to use a brim.
