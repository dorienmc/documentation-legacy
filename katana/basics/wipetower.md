## Wipe Tower
The wipe-tower is a tower printed on every layer (next to the to be printed model) when switching between nozzles. Used to start up a new extruder (get it to the right temperature before printing on the actual model), multi-color printing ('wipe' away old color), and also for unused extruders (to make sure they don't accidentally drip on the model). In case of dual extruding one can also use an ooze shield.
