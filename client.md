Welcome to the FORMIDE client developer documentation. On these pages, you will find information on what the FORMIDE client is, what it can do for you as a developer and complete references of our SDK's and API's. Next to that, you'll also find extensive documentation on how to extend the client with your own modules or contribute to it as it's open source.

### What is FORMIDEOS?
FORMIDEOS is a universal operating system for 3D printers created by Printr. It consists of multiple parts:

* FORMIDEOS client: the client software that ties everything together. It's open source so the community can contribute to it by fixing issues, adding features or writing modules for it. Includes native printer drivers.
* Katana slice engine: a custom slice engine built by Printr that's focussed on speed, features and easy integration in the FORMIDE workflow.
* FORMIDE cloud platform: a 3D printing cloud platform with many features, one of them being a remote connection for the client. You can control your 3D printer online via any device or invite friends to use it as well.

### Philosophy
We want 3D printing to be accessible by anyone. That's why we set out with 2 goals: making 3D printing really easy for people to use and making 3D printing accessible for developers as well. We strongly believe that 3D printing needs far better software in order to make it to the big masses. FORMIDE is our first step towards this mass adoption.

For developers, FORMIDE is built on 3 pillars: easy coding, extensibility and community. We want many developers to work with FORMIDE, either contribute to the core of the client, create apps or write new modules for it. We decided to use node.js (javascript) as the main language so we have a consistent language on both the back-end and front-end. Next to that, it's relatively easy to get into and it already has incredible momentum.
