This manual explains how to connect a printer to a FORMIDE client.

### Connect your printer
When you connect a compatible printer to The Element or your own device, a message will appear in the bottom of the sidebar (bottom right). When you click that message, a printer setup popup will appear. You can also trigger this popup manually by going to settings -> printers and click "Setup a new printer".

> Note that some printers don't have a unique ID on their USB chips, making it impossible for us to know which printer it is. There's a big chance that these printers will have to be setup again every time you reconnect the printer. We're working on improving USB recognition together with manufacturers.

### Setup
In the popup, you can select your printer model from a dropdown. We have preset for most popular compatible printers. If your printer is not in the list, feel free to contact us to have it added. You can also click "Manually setup a new printer" to enter the parameters of the printer manually. All the required parameters should be available at the manufacturer of the printer you own.
