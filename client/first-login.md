## Login
There are 2 ways you can enjoy FORMIDE: via the cloud or using the local interface. We encourage you to use the cloud version since we push updates to the cloud before the local version and the cloud has more features.

---

### Cloud
Go to [myaccount.formide.com/#/settings/devices](https://myaccount.formide.com/#/settings/devices), click on 'add new device' and follow the instructions. You must have a FORMIDE cloud account to connect your device to the cloud. Also, you should contact us (chris@printr.nl or via Slack) to whitelist your device's MAC address.

> When you buy The Element, the MAC address is already whitelisted. You don't have to take any action to get online.

---

### Local
Go to the IP address that the FORMIDE client is running on and go to port 8080. You'll be presented with a login screen. You can use the credentials you filled in during the setup process.

> We're working on auto detecting an Element in your local network as well as setting up an access point to configure it for the first time.
