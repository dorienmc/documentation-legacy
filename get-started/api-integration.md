## API Integration
This guide shows you the first steps into connecting your own website or app to the FORMIDE platform.

---
### Features
The FORMIDE API can add a lot of functionality to your application. Think about things like cloud slicing,
3D file storage, remote control of 3D printers and management of printer settings.

---
### Client libraries
We have a client library available for node.js that includes authentication methods, file uploading and slicing. For other languages, feel free to build your own library and share it with us, or use the Web API directly over HTTPS.

### Support
If you need any support when building your app, feel free to contact us through one of the support channels.
