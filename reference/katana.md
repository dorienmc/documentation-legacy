## Katana
Katana is a custom slice engine from Printr that was designed to fit seamless into the FORMIDE platform. We have thought a lot about how we as developers want to use a slice engine and came up with an easy way of telling the slicer what to do as well as listen to it's responses. Everything goes in as 1 JSON file and comes out as http-like status codes and responses. This way, we can keep slicing easy for everyone.

Katana runs on our cloud platform FORMIDE, embedded on The Element and as a stand-alone [desktop app](http://printr.com/katana).

### Philosophy
Why have we built our own slice engine? We had certain key values in mind that our slicing solution should have:

- Easy of use, put all the settings in the background
- Still have all settings available for the pro users
- Integration into our workflow
- Easy to use and maintain for developers, both internal and 3rd party
- Output for multiple machine types (FMD, DLP, SLS)
- Smart resource allocation in the cloud

We came to the conclusion that there was no slicer on the market yet that met all of these requirements, so we had to create our own solution. The result is Katana, named after the famous swords that Japanese samurai used.

At the moment, Katana is closed source. Feel free to contact us about any special inquery you have in your slicing needs.
