## Katana
Katana is a custom slice engine from Printr that was designed to fit seamless into the FORMIDE platform. We have thought a lot about how we as developers want to use a slice engine and came up with an easy way of telling the slicer what to do as well as listen to it's responses. Everything goes in as 1 JSON file and comes out as http-like status codes and responses. This way, we can keep slicing easy for everyone.

Katana runs on our cloud platform FORMIDE, embedded on The Element and as a stand-alone [http://printr.com/katana](desktop app).
