Katana is a custom slice engine built by Printr that integrates very well into the workflow of FORMIDE. Katana runs both in the cloud and embedded in the client.

### Philosophy
Why have we built our own slice engine? We had certain key values in mind that our slicing solution should have:

* Easy of use, put all the settings in the background
* Still have all settings available for the pro users
* Integration in our workflow
* Easy to use and maintain for developers, both internal and 3rd party
* Output for multiple machine types (FMD, DLP, SLS)
* Smart resource allocation in the cloud


We came to the conclusion that there was no slicer out there yet that met all of these goals, so we had to create our own. The result is Katana, named after the famous swords that Japanese samurai used. In this section, we explain all the inputs and outputs that Katana has and how developers can talk to Katana in their modules or applications. For now, Katana is a closed source project.
