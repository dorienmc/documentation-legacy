### Philosophy
We want 3D printing to be accessible by anyone. That's why we set out with 2 goals: making 3D printing really easy for people to use and making 3D printing accessible for developers as well. We strongly believe that 3D printing needs far better software in order to make it to the big masses. FORMIDE is our first step towards this mass adoption.

For developers, FORMIDE is built on 3 pillars: easy coding, extensibility and community. We want many developers to work with FORMIDE, either contribute to the core of the client, create apps or write new modules for it. We decided to use node.js (javascript) as the main language so we have a consistent language on both the back-end and front-end. Next to that, it's relatively easy to get into and it already has incredible momentum.
