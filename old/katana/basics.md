## Basics
This section gives an overview of what slicing does in 3D printing, what the basic features of a slicer are and how these are
implemented in Katana.

### Slicing
Slicing is the process of cutting a 3D model into layers in order to print it using a 3D printer. Almost all 3D printing
technologies use some form of slicing. Please refer to the subpages in this section to learn more about the parameters
that are involved with slicing and which effect they have on the final 3D printed result.

### Katana
Katana was custom built by Printr to integrate with the FORMIDE workflow, be super dynamic, work on all platforms, and include
the latest features that 3D printing users want to have. At this moment, Katana can generate output for FDM/FFF and DLP 3D printers.
