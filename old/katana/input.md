## Katana input

Range denotes the additional rules the user input must adhere to when given, hence the default value might lie outside of the range.
Almost all input variables are mandatory, non-mandatory input is in _italics_.

> Only user input is denoted, the type of input might differ from the type in Katana (eg. mode).
