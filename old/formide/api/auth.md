The FORMIDE API uses Oauth2 for authentication. This is a common authorisation scheme for APIs, used by Facebook, Twitter and Google as well. Oauth2 makes FORMIDE secure, both for developers as for the end users of the API and apps connected to it.

To authenticate, you need to follow 3 steps: register your app, authorise a user and obtain an access token. You can find how to do these steps one by one on the left navigation menu.
