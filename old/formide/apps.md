### App store
FORMIDE will feature an App store which will be filled with 3D printing related applications. These apps are created by the community (you!) or certified PRINTR developers.

The FORMIDE App store will have sections for different kind of apps. Most apps will run in your browser and you can directly print content from them to your own 3D printer or to a facilitator. Other apps might be desktop apps that you have to download or 3rd party websites that you can open in your browser.

### App structure
A typical FORMIDE app is basically an extension of the FORMIDE platform. The goal of this extension is to fill the platform with 3D content that owners of 3D printers and other 3D enthousiasts can use to create their own 3D models or customise existing ones.

FORMIDE apps have a certain file structure that we recommend. You're allowed to do basically everything that HTML, JavaScript and CSS allow you to do, but we made guidelines to get you started faster.

> At this point we don't check apps when they are uploaded. However, a rating system in the App store and app reporting will allow us to keep track of apps that are offensive in any way or contain explicit content.

> You are allowed to do everything with JavaScript that you want, including using external libraries. Apps will run in a sandboxed iFrame on FORMIDE, so it's impossible to mess with the FORMIDE source code.
