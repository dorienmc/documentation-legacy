## Auth
The Formide Client has it's own authentication layer to allow multiple users to access a device via the local interface.
We have 3 roles available for users: owner, admin and user. There can only be one owner at the time. This is also
the user that has to setup the cloud connection (automatically done when using The Element). Admin users can
edit other users, perform updates and configure the system. Users can edit resources, upload files, slice and use
the connected 3D printers.
