The FORMIDE client exposes multiple APIs that developers can work with. An internal api is available when you create modules for the client that have to integrate with the rest of the system. You can also use the HTTP API or the Websocket API to connect other applications to a local client instance. The HTTP and Websocket APIs are also available via an [online proxy](/#/docs/formide/api/clients/proxy/) so you can connect your applications to all instances of the client by calling a single url.
